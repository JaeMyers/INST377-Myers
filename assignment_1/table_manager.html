/* I do not know how to implement part 5 so I am going to use this comment area to explain what I wanted to implement but could not figure out.
 My idea was to start by implementing the stats table by hard coding the descriptive stats string that will not be decremented by the row clicks. 
I was then thinking to add a line in the row.onclick function that updates the descriptive statists int by decreasing number by the deleted content in the rows.
Something like "Total Number of High-Income Countries" + hiCountries(variable that holds total of high income countries that can be decremented.)
Maybe add a if statement saying if row 1 is deleted, certain desciptive elements will be decremented & so on...*/
